# Cuukin Tinder

This project goal was to build a tinder for recipes! Where you can like or dislike recipes based on your taste and then see a list of the 50 best recipes for you!

You can start playing in <a href = 'cuukintinder.herokuapp.com'>CuukinTinder</a>.

## Frontend

### Tools
The apps frontend was built using HMTL5, CSS3 and Bootstrap. All of this pages templates can be found in the "templates" folder. The recipes and the images were provided by the BBC Foods website  (more on this dataset later).
Most of the design was acquired from <a href="getbootstrap.com">Bootstrap</a>.

### Features
The app is very simple, consisting of a Login page, a main play page, a recipes page (where your recommendations are) and an about page for anyone who is interesting.
- Login: This is a very simple app, so you don't need to register with any password to get access. Just pop in any valid email and you're good to go! All your preferences will be stored in that e-mail account.
- Play: This is the main page. Cards with recipes images, title, description and extra information will appear for you to classify on Yes or No! Doing so will bring you the next recipe. If you are interested in any of those you can access theis link to get full access to the recipe in the bbc website!
- Recipes: This is the results page. Here you'll find listed the 50 recipes who best match your taste, based on what you selected while playing. The more you play the more accurate this will become!
- About: Simply an about page with some more insight on the project and the developer (me).
